# image-processing-shaders
 A university excercise where we were supposed to be implement shaders for processing an image in different ways.
 
 All code in the renderapp project is written by me, including the glsl code in the assets subfolder.  
 While running the program, press c to use no image processing, press b to use the blur shader, press g to use greyscale, and press e to use the edge shader.
